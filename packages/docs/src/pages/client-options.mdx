# Client Options

## DB options

These options define your local cache.

- `migrations` is a list of migrations to run on the local cache (which will define a schema, see [Schema](/schemas))
- `schema` is a hard coded schema for your local cache
- `storage` determines the storage engines for your local cache (see [Storage](/client-database/storage))

## Sync options

These options define how you want to sync with the server.

- `serverUrl` is the url of the server where your project lives e.g. `https://<project-id>.triplit.io`

The `serverUrl` can be updated with the `client.updateServerUrl` method.

## Auth options

These options define how you authenticate with your client database and remote database.

- `token` is a jwt that is used to identify the user to the client database and remote databases (see the [Auth guide](/guides/auth)). Providing a `token` will set the variable `$SESSION_USER_ID` on the database, which is used for authorization rules.
- `claimsPath` is the path to the Triplit claims on the token. It should be a `.` separated string like `path.to.claims`. This should match the value set on your project in the Triplit Dashboard.

The `token` can be updated with the `client.updateToken` method.

Use the `client.updateOptions` method if you need to update the `serverUrl` and `token` atomically.

Using `client.updateOptions`, `client.updateServerUrl` or `client.updateOptions` will result in the client closing its existing Websocket connection and attempting to open a new one with the provided URL/token.
