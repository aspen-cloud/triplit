# Select

To specify which attributes you want to return, you can use the `Select` method. This method accepts a list of attribute names for the collection as arguments.

```typescript
const query = client.query('users').Select(['id', 'name', 'email', 'dob']);
```

If the type you are selecting is a record, you may also select a specific attribute of the record by using dot notation. The result will be an object with just the selected keys.

```typescript
const query = client
  .query('users')
  .Select(['id', 'address.street', 'address.city']);
// {id: 'abc', address: {street: '123 Main St', city: 'New York'}}
```

If you do not call select on a query, all attributes are selected.

## Selecting relationships

Refer to the docs on [`Include`](/client/query/include) to learn how to select relationships in a query.
