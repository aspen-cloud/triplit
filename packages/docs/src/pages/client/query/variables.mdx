# Variables

Variables in Triplit allow you to pass in preset values into queries. They consist of a scope (to prevent collisions) and a dot (`.`) separated path to reference data in the variable.

### Query variables

Query variables are prefixed with the `query` scope and are accessible just to the query they are defined on. They are defined with the `vars` method in the query builder. For example:

```typescript
const baseQuery = client.query('employees').where([
  ['team', '=', 'Delivery Crew'],
  ['name', '=', '$query.name'],
]);
const fryQuery = baseQuery.vars({ name: 'Philip J. Fry' });
const leelaQuery = baseQuery.vars({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
```

This can help prevent writing the same query multiple times with different values.

### Global variables

Global variables are prefixed with the `global` scope and are accessible to all queries in the database. They are defined in the client constructor or via the `updateGlobalVariables` method. For example:

```typescript
const client = new TriplitClient({ variables: { name: 'Philip J. Fry' } });
let query = client.query('employees').where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Philip J. Fry'

client.db.updateGlobalVariables({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
query = client.query('employees').where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Turanga Leela'
```

### Session variables

Session variables are prefixed with the `session` scope and are accessible to all queries in that database session. When [authenticating](/auth) with a Triplit server, the server will assign all claims on the JWT to session variables.

### Role variables

When determining access control rules with [roles](/schemas/permissions#roles), you can use role variables to assigned values from the token in your permission definitions. Role variables are prefixed with the `role` scope.
