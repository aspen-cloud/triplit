# Self-hosting Triplit

To enable sync, you need to run a Triplit server. The server is a Node.js application that talks to various Triplit clients over WebSockets and HTTP.

You have several options for running the server:

- A local [development server](/local-development)
- Use [Docker](#docker) and a cloud provider that supports container deployments
- Use a [one-click deploy](#one-click-deploy) to a cloud provider that is integrated with Triplit.
- Build [a custom server](#building-a-custom-server) and use a cloud provider that supports Git-based deploys

## Docker

Each release of the server is [published as a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/aspencloud/triplit-server/tags). You can deploy the server to a cloud provider like [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/), [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/deploy-from-container-images/), or AWS. You'll also want to setup a volume to persist the database.

## One-click deploy

Triplit is integrated with [Railway](https://railway.app/), a cloud provider that supports one-click deploys. Read about how to deploy a Triplit server using Railway in our [Triplit Cloud guide](/triplit-cloud/self-hosted-deployments).

We plan on adding support for more cloud providers in the future. If you have a favorite cloud provider that you'd like to see integrated with Triplit, let us know by [joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/q89sGWHqQ5).

## Building a custom server

The server is published as an NPM package, and you can install it by running:

```bash copy
npm install @triplit/server
```

The server also contains the remote Triplit database, which will persist data synced from your clients. The server supports different storage adapters, such as SQLite. Using the `createServer` function, you can create and configure a new server instance:

```js filename="run.js" copy
import { createServer } from '@triplit/server';

const port = +(process.env.PORT || 8080);

const startServer = createServer({
  storage: 'sqlite',
  verboseLogs: true,
});

const dbServer = startServer(port);

console.log('running on port', port);
process.on('SIGINT', function () {
  dbServer.close(() => {
    console.log('Shutting down server... ');
    process.exit();
  });
});
```

You can now deploy the server to a cloud provider that supports Git deploys, like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git), [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/), or [Render](https://docs.render.com/deploys).

### Storage

Triplit is designed to support any storage that can implement a key value store. You may specify the storage adapter you want to use by setting the `storage` option. Triplit provides some default configurations of our storage adapters, which you can use by setting the `storage` option to the appropriate string value for the adapter. These include:

- `file` - A simple file-based storage adapter
- `leveldb` - A LevelDB storage adapter, which requires the installation of the [`level` package](https://github.com/Level/level)
- `lmdb` - An LMDB storage adapter, which requires the installation of the [`lmdb` package](https://github.com/kriszyp/lmdb-js)
- `memory` (default) - See `memory-btree`
- `memory-array` - An in-memory storage adapter backed by an array
- `memory-btree` - An in-memory storage adapter backed by a B-Tree
- `sqlite` - An SQLite storage adapter, which requires the installation of the [`better-sqlite3` package](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  In-memory storage adapters are not durable and are not recommended for
  production use.
</Callout>

Typically this will use your `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` environment variable so you'll want to make sure that's set.

You can also pass in an instance of an adapter or a function that returns an instance of an adapter.

```typescript
function createAdapter() {
  return new MyCustomAdapter();
}

const startServer = createServer({
  storage: createAdapter,
});
```

## Secrets

There are a few secrets that you need to provide to the server to enable certain features. **If you are planning on using the Triplit Dashboard, you will need to set `PROJECT_ID` and `JWT_SECRET` to specific values associated with your project.** Read the [Triplit Cloud guide](/triplit-cloud/self-hosted-deployments#configuration) for more information.

### `PROJECT_ID`

The server uses a `PROJECT_ID` to identify your project. You can set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable to a unique identifier for your project. If you would like to connect to the Triplit Dashboard, this value should be the unique identifier for your project. You can find this value in the dashboard in your project's settings.

### `JWT_SECRET`

The server uses JWT tokens to authenticate clients, and you need to provide a secret to sign and verify these tokens. You can set the secret by setting the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable. Triplit supports both symmetric (HS256) and asymmetric (RS256) encryption algorithms for JWTs. You will need to generate client tokens signed with the appropriate algorithm. With the `PROJECT_ID` and `JWT_SECRET` set, you can also use the [`triplit dev`](/cli/dev) CLI to generate these tokens for you.

```bash copy
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id JWT_SECRET=your-secret triplit dev
```

You can also do it with the `jsonwebtoken` package (e.g. if you wanted to use asymmetric encryption) :

```typescript copy
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const anonKey = jwt.sign(
  {
    'x-triplit-token-type': 'anon',
    'x-triplit-project-id': process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  },
  process.env.PUBLIC_KEY,
  { algorithm: 'RS256' }
);

const serviceKey = jwt.sign(
  {
    'x-triplit-token-type': 'secret',
    'x-triplit-project-id': process.env.PROJECT_ID,
  },
  process.env.PUBLIC_KEY,
  { algorithm: 'RS256' }
);
```

For more complicated authentication schemes, refer to our [authentication guide](/auth).

### `EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` (optional)

If you want your server to support JWTs signed by a second issuer, you can also set `EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` to that signing secret (or public key). The server will only authenticate signatures with this secret if the JWT has the `x-triplit-token-type` claim set to `external`. Any JWT that does not have this claim set will be authenticated with `JWT_SECRET`.

### `CLAIMS_PATH` (optional)

If you are using custom JWTs with nested Triplit-related claims, you can set the `CLAIMS_PATH` environment variable. The server will read the Triplit claims at the path specified by `CLAIMS_PATH`. The JWT should also have the `x-triplit-token-type` claim set to `external`. Read the [authentication guide](/auth) for more information.

### `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` (optional)

If you use the `sqlite` storage adapter, the server will create the database file at `./app.db` in the server's directory. If you want to override this (as is sometimes necessary for Cloud providers with their own separately managed storage volumes) you can set the `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### `SENTRY_DSN` (optional)

If you want to log errors to Sentry, you can set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. The server will automatically log errors to Sentry.

### `VERBOSE_LOGS` (optional)

If you want to log all incoming and outgoing messages and requests, you can set the `VERBOSE_LOGS` environment variable. This can be useful for debugging.
