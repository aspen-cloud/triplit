# Deploying to Fly.io

Below are the steps to deploy your Triplit server on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). If there are issues with your deployment, please see the [Fly.io documentation](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/) for the latest information.

## Deploy your app

<Steps>
### Create a Fly.io account and install the Fly.io CLI

The first thing you'll need is to create a Fly.io account and install the Fly.io CLI. You can create an account from Fly.io's [homepage](https://fly.io/) and you can install it by following the instructions on the [Fly.io installation page](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/).

### Launch your Fly.io application

Now you're ready to deploy your Triplit server on Fly.io. You should create a directory for your application, though this will just be a container for Fly's configuration file. Inside your project folder, run the following command to initialize your Fly.io application:

```bash
fly launch \
    --image aspencloud/triplit-server:latest \
    --volume triplitdb:/mnt/triplitdb \
    --volume-initial-size 5 \
    # FILL ME IN, see docs on proper value of JWT_SECRET
    --secret JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret> \
    --secret LOCAL_DATABASE_URL=/mnt/triplitdb/app.db
```

Additional useful options include:

- `--image aspencloud/triplit-server:<version>`: Pin a specific version of the Triplit server. Change the value in your `fly.toml` as needed.
- `--name <app-name>`: Specify a name for your application.
- `--region <region>`: Specify a [region](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/) to deploy your application in.
- `--no-deploy`: Prevents the application from being deployed immediately, allowing you to inspect the configuration first.

All launch options can be found in the [Fly.io documentation](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/launch/).

This will create a `fly.toml` file in your project directory that defines your app [configuration](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/).

### Deploy your application

If you didn't use the `--no-deploy` option, your application will already be deployed. If you did, you can deploy your application by running:

```bash
fly deploy
```

This is how you can continue to deploy your app in the future.

### Test the server is up

You can test if your server is up and running by sending a request to the Fly.io application URL. You can use `curl` or any HTTP client to send a request:

```bash
curl https://<your-app-name>.fly.dev/healthcheck
```

You should see a response from your Triplit server.

### Configure additional environment variables

Depending on your setup, you may need to configure additional environment variables for Triplit listed [here](/self-hosting#secrets). You can do this by running:

```bash
fly secrets set SECRET_1=value1 SECRET_2=value2 ...
```

These secrets will be available the next time you deploy your application. More info can be found in the [Fly.io documentation on secrets](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/secrets/).
