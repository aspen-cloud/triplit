# Deploying to Railway

Below are the steps to deploy your Triplit server on [Railway](https://railway.app/). If there are issues with your deployment, please see the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start) for the latest information.

Railway does have a free tier but it is very limited. We recommend using the Hobby plan at minimum.

## One Click Deploy

You can deploy your Triplit server to Railway with a single click using the following button:

<Callout>
  Please ensure you set the `JWT_SECRET` to your own secret value. If you forget
  to, it can be overriden at anytime. More information on generating a JWT
  secret can be found. [here](/self-hosting/key-gen).
</Callout>

This will create a new Railway project with the Triplit server pre-configured. You will need at minimum a Hobby plan to deploy from a template. Please ensure you set the `JWT_SECRET` to your own secret value.

## Manual Deployment (Dashboard)

<Steps>
### Create a Railway account

Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and create an account if you don't have one already. Railway does have a free tier but it is very limited. We recommend using the Hobby plan at minimum.

### Create a new service from the Triplit Docker image

Follow the steps to create a service from a docker image in the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start#deploying-your-project---from-a-docker-image), using `aspencloud/triplit-server:latest` as the docker image.

### Add a volume to your service

Create a volume by following the steps in the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.com/guides/volumes#creating-a-volume). Set the mount path to `/mnt/triplitdb`, or any other path you prefer.

### Configure environment variables

You may see logs that your service is not running or failing, this is expected as you need to configure the environment variables first.

- Set `JWT_SECRET` to your desired JWT secret (see [here](/self-hosting/key-gen) for more information).
- Set `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` to `/mnt/triplitdb/app.db` (or any other path you prefer, but make sure it matches the mount path of your volume).

### Expose your service

Expose a public URL by following the steps in the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain).

### Test your server is up

Test your server is up by sending a request to the Railway application URL. You can use `curl` or any HTTP client to send a request:

```bash
curl https://<railway-domain>/healthcheck
```
