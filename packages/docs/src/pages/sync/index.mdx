# Syncing Data

Triplit is most powerful when it is used to sync data across multiple devices and users. Every Triplit Client is equiped with a sync engine that is responsible for managing the connection to the server and syncing data between your local database and remote database.

## Setting up sync

To set up syncing, you need to tell your Triplit Client how to connect to the remote database with the `sync` options in the constructor. Additional options can be found [here](/client-options).

```typescript
const client = new TriplitClient({
  sync: {
    server: '<remote database origin>',
  },
  auth: {
    token: '<access token>',
  },
});
```

## Example

[Once you've installed](/getting-started) the Triplit CLI, you can run the following command to start a local Triplit Server (and remote database):

```bash
triplit dev
```

By default this will set up a server at `localhost:6543`, and should display an access token for your database.

You can run this script in multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users/devices connecting and sending data.

```typescript
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  sync: {
    server: 'localhost:6543',
  },
  auth: {
    token: '<access token>',
  },
});

const query = client.query('todos').build();

client.subscribe(query, (todos) => {
  console.log(todos);
});

client.insert('todos', {
  text: 'My Todo',
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```
