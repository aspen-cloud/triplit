# Triplit Cloud

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Triplit Cloud is no longer accepting new users, and we recommend that you
  self-host your Triplit database instead. Please see our [self-hosting
  guide](/self-hosting) for more information on how to set up your own Triplit
  server.

Triplit Cloud is a service for managing your Triplit projects. It's free for individuals to use, and integrates with your Triplit server, whether it's managed by us or self-hosted. When you integrate with Triplit Cloud you get access to a range of features, including:

- **The Triplit Console**: A graphical interface for managing your data and schema.
- **Authorization**: Configure access to your server without needing to modify your server's code.

To get started with Triplit Cloud, read one of our guides below:

- [Deploying a Triplit-hosted server](/triplit-cloud/managed-machines)
- [Deploying a self-hosted server](/triplit-cloud/self-hosted-deployments)
