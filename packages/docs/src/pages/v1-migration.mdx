# Migrating to Triplit 1.0

Triplit 1.0 is here. It's a major upgrade that includes significant improvements to performance and reliability. There are also several improvements to the API, including:

- Simplified query syntax and the removal of `.build()` from the query builder API
- More type hinting when defining permissions and relations in a schema.
- Easier self-hosted server setup with fewer required environment variables.

Because Triplit 1.0 uses a new data storage format and redesigned sync protocol, client and server must be updated in tandem, and neither will be backwards compatible with their pre-1.0 counterparts. The server upgrade involves a data migration. If you're using Triplit Cloud, we'll handle this for you when you're ready to upgrade. If you're self-hosting, you can follow the instructions in the [server upgrade section](#migrating-your-server) below.

## Query builder

### Capitalization and `.build()`

Anywhere you have a Triplit query defined in your app, you'll need to make some subtle updates. Every builder method (e.g. `.Where`, `.Select`, `.Include`) is now capitalized. In addition, you no longer need to call `.build()` at the end of your query. Here's an example of a query before and after the upgrade:

Before:

```ts
const query = triplit
  .query('todos')
  .where('completed', '=', false)
  .order('created_at', 'ASC')
  .include('assignee')
  .build();
```

After:

```ts
const query = triplit
  .query('todos')
  .Where('completed', '=', false)
  .Order('created_at', 'ASC')
  .Include('assignee');
```

### `SyncStatus`

The `SyncStatus` parameter has been changed from a query builder method to an option on `TriplitClient.subscribe` and `TriplitClient.fetch` and their permutations (e.g. `fetchOne`, `fetchById`).

Before:

```ts
const unsyncedTodosQuery = triplit.query('todos').syncStatus('pending').build();

const result = triplit.fetch(unsyncedTodosQuery);
const unsubscribeHandler = triplit.subscribe(unsyncedTodosQuery, (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

After:

```ts
const unsyncedTodosQuery = triplit.query('todos');

const result = triplit.fetch(unsyncedTodosQuery, {
  syncStatus: 'pending',
});
const unsubscribeHandler = triplit.subscribe(
  unsyncedTodosQuery,
  (result) => {
    console.log(result);
  },
  undefined,
  {
    syncStatus: 'pending',
  }
);
```

### `subquery` builder method

The `.subquery` builder method has been replaced with two new methods: `.SubqueryOne` and `.SubqueryMany`. Previously the `.subquery` method required a `cardinality` parameter to specify whether the subquery was for a single or multiple entities. These new methods are more explicit and provide better type hinting.

Before:

```ts
const query = triplit
  .query('todos')
  .subquery(
    'assignee',
    triplit.query('users').where('name', '=', 'Alice').build(),
    'one'
  )
  .build();
```

After:

```ts {3}
const query = triplit
  .query('todos')
  .SubqueryOne('assignee', triplit.query('users').Where('name', '=', 'Alice'));
```

## Schema

### Reorganized schema sections and better type hinting

- Relations in your schema are now defined in a `relationships` section. This makes it easier to see at a glance how your data is connected, and provides better type hinting when you're working with your schema.

- The `ClientSchema` type has been removed in favor of an `S.Collections` method that gives better type hinting when defining your schema.

Here's an example of a schema before and after the upgrade:

Before:

```ts
import { Schema as S, type ClientSchema } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = {
  todos: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      text: S.String(),
      completed: S.Boolean(),
      assigneeId: S.String(),
      assignee: S.RelationById('users', '$1.assigneeId'),
    }),
  },
  users: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
    }),
  },
} satisfies ClientSchema;
```

After:

```ts {3,11-13}
import { Schema as S } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = S.Collections({
  todos: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      text: S.String(),
      completed: S.Boolean(),
      assigneeId: S.String(),
    }),
    relationships: {
      assignee: S.RelationById('users', '$1.assigneeId'),
    },
  },
  users: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      name: S.String(),
    }),
  },
});
```

### New `S.Default.Set.empty()` option

The `S.Default.Set.empty()` is a new option for the `default` option in a `Set` attribute. Here's how to use it:

```ts {9}
import { Schema as S } from '@triplit/client';

const schema = S.Collections({
  todos: {
    schema: S.Schema({
      id: S.Id(),
      text: S.String(),
      completed: S.Boolean(),
      tags: S.Set(S.String(), { default: S.Default.Set.empty() }),
    }),
  },
});
```

### Changed type helpers

The `EntityWithSelection` type, previously used to extract an entity from the schema with a specific selection, has been replaced with a `QueryResult` type. This new type is more flexible and provides better type hinting when working with your schema.

Before:

```ts
import { type EntityWithSelection } from '@triplit/client';
import { schema } from './schema';

type UserWithPosts = EntityWithSelection<
  typeof schema,
  'users', // collection
  ['name'], // selection
  { posts: true } // inclusions
>;
```

After:

```ts
import { type QueryResult } from '@triplit/client';
import { schema } from './schema';
import { triplit } from './client';

type UserWithPosts = QueryResult<
  typeof schema,
  { collectionName: 'users'; select: ['name']; include: { posts: true } }
>;
```

## Client configuration

### `storage` changed

The `storage` option in the `TriplitClient` no longer accepts an object with `cache` and `outbox` properties. Instead, you can continue to pass in the simple string values `memory` or `indexeddb`, or in the uncommon case that you are creating your own storage provider, an instance of a `KVStore` (which is a new interface in Triplit 1.0). If you need to specify a name for your IndexedDB database, you can pass in an object with a `type` property set to `'indexeddb'` and a `name` property set to the desired name of your database.

Before:

```ts
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
import { IndexedDbStorage } from '@triplit/db/storage/indexed-db';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: {
    outbox: new IndexedDBStorage('my-database-outbox'),
    cache: new IndexedDBStorage('my-database-cache'),
  },
});
```

After:

```ts
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: {
    type: 'indexeddb',
    name: 'my-database',
  },
});

// also works if you don't need to specify a name
const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: 'indexeddb',
});
```

### Storage imports

If you chose to import storage providers directly, previously our storage providers were only exported from `@triplit/db`, so you needed to install `@triplit/db` alongside `@triplit/client`. Providers are now directly exported by `@triplit/client`.

Before:

```ts
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
import { IndexedDbStorage } from '@triplit/db/storage/indexed-db';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: {
    outbox: new IndexedDBStorage('my-database-outbox'),
    cache: new IndexedDBStorage('my-database-cache'),
  },
});
```

After:

```ts
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';
import { IndexedDbStorage } from '@triplit/client/storage/indexed-db';

const client = new TriplitClient({
  storage: new IndexedDbStorage('my-database'),
});
```

For most purposes, you should only need to install `@triplit/client`.

### `experimental.entityCache` removed

The `experimental.entityCache` option has been removed from the `TriplitClient` configuration. This option is no longer needed in Triplit 1.0.

## Client methods

### Deleting optional attributes

Previously, deleting an optional attribute in the `TriplitClient.update` method would remove the key from the entity. Any attribute wrapped in `S.Optional` would be of type `T | undefined`.

Now, deleting an optional attribute will set the attribute to `null`, and the attribute will be of type `T | undefined | null`.

### `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `transact` return types changed

These methods no longer return a `{ txId, output }` object. Instead, if they have an output, e.g. `insert`, they return it directly.

Before:

```ts
import { triplit } from './client';

// output is the inserted entity
const { txId, output } = await triplit.insert('todos', {
  id: '1',
  text: 'Buy milk',
});
const { txId } = await triplit.update('todos', '1', (e) => {
  e.text = 'Buy buttermilk';
});
const { txId } = await triplit.delete('todos', '1');
```

After:

```ts
import { triplit } from './client';

const output = await triplit.insert('todos', { text: 'Buy milk' });

// these methods have no return value
await triplit.update('todos', '1', (e) => {
  e.text = 'Buy buttermilk';
});
await triplit.delete('todos', '1');
```

Retrying and rollback with `TxId` is no longer necessary, as the sync engine now handles rollbacks with a new API. See below for more details.

### Sync error handling methods changed

The `TriplitClient` methods `retry`, `rollback`, `onTxSuccessRemote`, and `onTxFailureRemote` have been replaced with a new API for handling sync errors. The new methods include `onFailureToSyncWrites`, `onEntitySyncError`, `onEntitySyncSuccess`, `clearPendingChangesForEntity` and `clearPendingChangesForAll`. Instead of registering callbacks for a specific transaction, you may register callbacks for a specific entity.

It is important that you handle sync errors in your app code, as the sync engine can get blocked if the entity that causes the error is not removed from the outbox or updated.

Before:

```ts
import { triplit } from './client';

const { txId } = await triplit.insert('todos', { id: '1', text: 'Buy milk' });

triplit.onTxSuccessRemote(txId, () => {
  console.log('Transaction succeeded');
});

triplit.onTxFailureRemote(txId, () => {
  console.log('Transaction failed');
  triplit.rollback(txId);
});
```

After:

```ts
import { triplit } from './client';

const insertedEntity = await triplit.insert('todos', {
  id: '1',
  text: 'Buy milk',
});

triplit.onEntitySyncSuccess('todos', '1', () => {
  console.log('Entity synced');
});

// if you need to full rollback
triplit.onEntitySyncError('todos', '1', () => {
  triplit.clearPendingChangesForEntity('todos', '1');
});

// if you can handle the error and want to try with a changed entity
// mutating the entity will trigger a new sync
triplit.onEntitySyncError('todos', '1', () => {
  triplit.update('todos', '1', (e) => {
    e.text = 'Buy buttermilk';
  });
});

// if you want to listen to any failed write over sync
triplit.onFailureToSyncWrites((error, writes) => {
  console.error('Failed to sync writes', error, writes);
  await triplit.clearPendingChangesAll();
});
```

### `getSchemaJSON` removed

The `getSchemaJSON` method has been removed from the `TriplitClient` API, as the schema is now JSON by default.

Before:

```ts
import { triplit } from './client';

const serializedSchema = await triplit.getSchemaJSON();
```

After:

```ts {3}
import { schema } from './schema';
const serializedSchema = await triplit.getSchema();
```

## Frameworks

### Angular

Triplit previously maintained two sets of Angular bindings: the signal-based `injectQuery` and the observable-based `createQuery`. In Triplit 1.0, we've removed the signal-based bindings in favor of the more flexible and powerful observable-based bindings. If you're using the signal-based bindings, you'll need to update your app to use the observable-based bindings. Generally this means adopting the [Async pipe syntax](https://v17.angular.io/guide/observables-in-angular#async-pipe) in your templates or by using the [`@angular/rxjs-interop` package](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/rxjs-interop) to translate them to signals.

### Expo / React Native

#### Expo SQLite storage provider

There's a new storage provider for Expo applications that use the `expo-sqlite` package. You can now use the `ExpoSQLiteKVStore` storage provider to store data on the device. This provider is available in the `@triplit/client` package.

```ts
import { ExpoSQLiteKVStore } from '@triplit/client/storage/expo-sqlite';
import { TriplitClient } from '@triplit/client';

new TriplitClient({
  storage: new ExpoSQLiteKVStore('triplit.db'),
});
```

You should use a new name for your SQLite database to avoid conflicts with any legacy Triplit databases on the device.

#### @triplit/react-native

We moved relevant React Native code to a new `@triplit/react-native` package. This includes various helpers for configuring your app with Expo and Triplit and re-exports the same hooks available in the `@triplit/react` package. You can find updating information on setting up a react project with Triplit [here](/frameworks/react-native).

### HTTP API

If you're using the [`HttpClient`](/client/http-client) to interact with the HTTP API, you won't need to make any changes to your code. If you're interacting with the API directly (e.g. with a raw `fetch` call):

- The `/fetch` route now returns an flatter JSON payload of query results (`Entity[]`), rather than a JSON object of the shape`{ result : [string, Entity][] }`.

So for this query:

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://<project-id>.triplit.io/fetch', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer ' + TRIPLIT_TOKEN,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    collection: 'todos',
    query: {
      collectionName: 'todos',
      where: [['completed', '=', false]],
    },
  }),
});
```

Before:

```ts
const result = await response.json();
// result = { result: [['123',{ id: '123', title: 'Buy milk', completed: false }]] }
```

After:

```ts
const result = await response.json();
// result = [{ id: '123', title: 'Buy milk', completed: false }]
```

While the query builder methods (.e.g `Where`, `Order`, `Include`) have changed capitalization, keys in a json query payload remain lowercase.

## Migrating your server

### Triplit Cloud

If you're on a Triplit Cloud database, you don't need to do anything to upgrade your server. We'll handle the upgrade for you when you're ready to upgrade. Just contact us in the [Triplit Discord](https://discord.gg/triplit) or at [help@triplit.dev](mailto:help@triplit.dev).

### Self hosted

If you're self hosting, you'll need to migrate your own database. Triplit provides a few tools that are helpful for this process, but it is up to you to ensure you safely migrate the database for your application's needs.

If you are using SQLite for storage (which is the default) and you are re-using the same machine, it is recommended that you delete your existing database file(s) during the migration. These files should exist at the path you have specified by your `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` variable. This isn't strictly necessary, but highly recommended as it will improve the performance of the database and ensures no data from V0 is carried over.

There are a variety of ways you could go about migrating data from V0 to V1, but generally the steps to migrate your server are:

1. If you have outside traffic to your server and want to re-use your machine, we recommend that you disable that traffic during the migration. For example, if you are directly serving a docker container you can change the port that the container is exposed on. Alternatively, you could deploy to a different machine that won't have outside traffic.
2. Take a snapshot of your database with `triplit snapshot create`.
3. If you are re-using your machine, delete your existing database file(s).
4. Pointing to the server you would like to push to, run `triplit snapshot push --snapshot=<snapshotId>`.
5. With an updated schema as described above, run `triplit schema push`.
6. Congratulations, you have successfully migrated your server from V0 to V1! If things seem stable, you may now re-enable traffic to your server. If anything seems incorrect, you should have your data saved in a snapshot.

If you would like any help or have any questions, please reach out to us in the [Triplit Discord](https://discord.gg/triplit) or at [help@triplit.dev](mailto:help@triplit.dev).
