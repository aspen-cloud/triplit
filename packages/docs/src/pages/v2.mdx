  have to our [Github](https://triplit.dev/github) or
  [Discord](https://triplit.dev/discord).

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a project to Triplit Cloud. It will cover

1. [How to authenticate with Triplit Cloud using the CLI](#authenticate-with-triplit-cloud)
2. [How to deploy a project to Triplit Cloud](#deploy-your-project)
3. [How to monitor your deployment with the Triplit dashboard](#viewing-your-deployments)

## Prerequisites

- A Triplit project. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the
  [Getting Started with Triplit](/getting-started) guide.
- The Triplit CLI. You can install it by running `npm install -g @triplit/cli`.

## Authenticate with Triplit Cloud

To authenticate with Triplit Cloud, run the following command from inside your project directory:

```bash copy
triplit login
```

This will ask you to enter an email, and will send a one-time password to your email. After entering the one-time password, you will be authenticated with Triplit Cloud.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you already have access to the [Triplit
  Dashboard](https://triplit.dev/dashboard), make sure you enter the same email
  you used to sign up for the dashboard.
</Callout>

You'll also be asked to select an organization or create a new one. If you're part of an organization, you can select it from the list. If you're not part of an organization, you can create a new one.

```stdout
Choose an organization to work with:

? Select an organization › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Create a new organization
```

You can then run `triplit whoami` to verify that you are authenticated.

```
You're logged in as phil@superdev.com
You're currently working with the organization Super Dev Team
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you want to set up multiple organizations and switch between them, run
  `triplit org`.
</Callout>

## Create and link to a cloud project

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you've used Triplit Cloud in its prior iteration, your existing projects
  will be marked as "Legacy" in the dashboard and are wholly separate from the
  deploy flow described here. If you have any questions or need help, please
  reach out to us on [Discord](https://triplit.dev/discord).
</Callout>

To deploy a project to Triplit Cloud, you need to create a cloud project. To create a cloud project, run the following command:

```bash copy
triplit project create
```

This will create a project in Triplit Cloud that will be associated with the current organization you're working with. This command will also create a `triplit.config.json` file in your project directory that looks like this:

```json filename="triplit.config.json"
{
  "id": "project-1234",
  "name": "my-project"
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If at any time you want to change the cloud project that your local project is
  linked to, run `triplit project link`.
</Callout>

## Copy in your environment variables

To connect the Triplit Client in your App to the Triplit Cloud project you created, you'll need to have a properly configured `.env` file in your project. You can view the environment variables from the Triplit Cloud project by running the following command:

```bash copy
triplit project manage
```

This will print a url to the Triplit Cloud dashboard where you can manage your project. You can then copy the environment variables from the dashboard and paste them into your `.env` file.

  src={dashboardOverview}
  style={{ borderRadius: 8, marginTop: 16 }}
  width={800}
  height={800}
  alt="The Triplit Dashboard (overview page)"
/>

## Deploy your project

This part's easy: just run `triplit deploy`. This will bundle your project, including it's `./triplit/schema.ts` file, and deploy it to Triplit Cloud.

```bash copy
triplit deploy
```

If you've used a previous iteration of Triplit Cloud and are expecting to run
various `triplit migrate` commands, these are no longer necessary. If you update
your schema, simply run `triplit deploy` again and your changes will be
reflected in the cloud.

## Viewing your deployments

You can view your deployments in the Triplit Cloud dashboard. To open the dashboard, run the following command again:

```bash copy
triplit project manage
```

Go to the "Deployments" tab to see all of your deployments.

<Image
  src={dashboardDeployments}
  style={{ borderRadius: 8, marginTop: 16 }}
  width={800}
  height={800}
  alt="The Triplit Dashboard (deployments page)"
/>
